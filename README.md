# CreaScribe

We built the mobile application “CreaScribe” which can record observations to creatures along our daily life. In detail, the application allows uploading photos and records from a single user, and the user can see others records in Taiwan. We also provide search function which can help the user to learn more knowledge about a creature and to recognize the distribution of the creature in Taiwan. Moreover, we encourage users to understand roadkill datas and contribute on collecting these datas.
